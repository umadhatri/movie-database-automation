# Movie Database Automation with Python
This repo holds the code that I have used to automate my google sheet with python

## Inspiration
I always wanted to work with Google APIs and create an automation script. This was the perefect opportunity. So, I used Python(too good to not use it in a project like this) to write a smiple automation script (this is my first time writing an automation script, btw).

## What does the script do?
The script uses the Google API to automate the addition of data that I input. It asks me the information about the movie that I have seem like its title, release date, genres, director's name(s) and the casts' names. Pretty simple and sweet

## Do I intend on improving it?
Yes, 100% I do. Next, maybe I can include a higher functionality such that if I give only the movie name, the script can scrape the web to find the rest of the data needed and add it to the script as needed.
